# NumPy Labs

## Overview

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on practical exercises and labs for learning and mastering NumPy operations. These exercises are ideal for those who want to deepen their understanding of numerical data manipulations in Python.

## Notebooks

### 1. NumPy_Assignment1.ipynb

#### Lab - Basic NumPy Operations

- **Purpose**: To practice basic operations and manipulations using NumPy.
- **Exercises**:
  - Creating arrays with specific values.
  - Basic array operations such as addition and accessing array characteristics.
  - Advanced manipulations like array concatenation, reshaping, and using conditions.
  - Exploring array indexing and slicing for accessing and modifying data.

### 2. NumPy_Assignment2.ipynb

#### Lab - Advanced NumPy Operations

- **Purpose**: To explore more complex NumPy functionalities and understand multidimensional array manipulations.
- **Exercises**:
  - Creating and manipulating 3-D and 4-D arrays.
  - Converting data types of array elements.
  - Using advanced indexing techniques and slicing to access array elements.
  - Utilizing array manipulation functions such as `reshape`, `where`, and `nditer`.
  - Joining and splitting arrays to reorganize data effectively.

## Setup

1. Python 3.11
2. NumPy library
3. Jupyter Notebook
